A new cider is born! After 12 days in the fermenter, I transferred it to the carboy for clarification. I should be able to bottle this next weekend at the earliest. I've brewed cider 2 or 3 times in the past. This is the first time I haven't used a kit. This recipe is anything but complex. The expectation is it be less dry than other homebrewed ciders. Instead of champagne yeast, I used an ale yeast. Since I tossed in some raspberry flavoring, we should soon be enjoying something resembling a raspberry flavored Strongbow.

Here's the [recipe](https://gist.github.com/1208886 "recipe"), tracked in a gist.

###Liquid
* 4 Gallons Tree Top, liquid

###Sugars
* 1 lb cane sugar dissolved in water

###Adjuncts
+ 2 fl oz Raspberry flavoring

###Yeast
+ 1318 London Ale III (wyeast)
