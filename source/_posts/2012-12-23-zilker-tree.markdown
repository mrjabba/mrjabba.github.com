Zilker is my backyard. Every holiday season, they take the [moon tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower) in Zilker and decorate it as a tree.

From a distance, you can see the tree. We took this from one of the tee off spots for disc golf at night.

This shot is from standing underneath the tower(tree).

Next, spin around with your camera in the air. Yay!
